The steps to setting up and seeing the Art Shopping Center in action involve setting up both front/end of the project [with the backend prior to the frontend so it can properly communicate with the webpage].
The only prerequisites to installation are having the following already installed on your machine

1. [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) [Preferred Installer Program]
2. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) [Node Package Manager]

As mentioned we need to first setup the backend of the project which is done as follows:
(TODO: @Martin needs to update this with instructions on how to both install dependencies from the req.txt file and getting the server up and running)

1.

Now that you've finished setting up and got the backend running we can get the frontend up and running

1. From the terminal enter the /front_end folder
2. Perform the following commands within this folder [note that each line should be performed separately and may take some time for each]

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

3. Now that you've done this navigate to the link shown in the terminal [which should display a message that looks like the following]

```bash
> shopping_center_fe@0.0.0 preview
> vite preview

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:4173/  <Navigate to the link on this line>
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
